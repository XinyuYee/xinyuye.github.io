I am a PhD candidate in Electronic Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by Prof. Junchi Yan. Prior to this, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from Wuhan University (SDU), advised by Prof. Jiaya Ma. My research topics include graph neural networks, combinatorial optimization, quantum machine learning, and image feature matching. 

I am always open for collaboration opportunities and please feel free to contact me via email: xinyu_ye@sjtu.edu.cn
